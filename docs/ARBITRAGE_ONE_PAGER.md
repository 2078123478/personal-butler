# Personal Butler Arbitrage Module — One Pager

**The Arbitrage Module is the first flagship strategy module inside Personal Butler.**

It is designed to turn **Binance ecosystem capabilities** into **risk-aware arbitrage decisions** for BNB ecosystem-native workflows.

In one line:

> instead of exposing raw market calls, the module discovers opportunities, enriches them with context, simulates post-cost viability, and produces execution-ready decisions.

---

## TL;DR

- **BNB ecosystem-native direction:** the module is framed for the BNB / Binance ecosystem, not as a generic standalone trading bot.
- **Binance Skills-compatible:** it is meant to build on official open skills for market context, balance readiness, token metadata, token risk, and optional signal enrichment.
- **Execution-backed:** it keeps the current OnchainOS-based backend for real workflow execution.
- **Decision-first:** the value is not just “can it trade?” but “should it act after costs, safety checks, and policy constraints?”

---

## What problem it solves

Most trading demos stop too early.
They show:

- a market quote
- a spread
- maybe an execution call

That is not enough.

A real arbitrage product has to answer:

- is the opportunity real?
- is it still valid after fees, slippage, gas, and latency?
- is the token or venue context safe enough?
- do we have the assets and permissions required?
- should this be ignored, simulated, proposed, or executed?

The Arbitrage Module is designed to answer those questions in a structured way.

## Why it matters for the BNB ecosystem

This module is not meant to be a generic “bot with APIs.”
It is meant to be a **BNB ecosystem-native strategy layer**.

That matters because the ecosystem needs more than raw capability access.
It needs tools that can:

- discover opportunities
- evaluate them responsibly
- simulate before action
- execute within constraints
- explain outcomes clearly

That is where Personal Butler fits.

## How it fits the architecture

### 1. Binance official open skills = capability layer

These skills provide ecosystem-facing building blocks such as:

- market / execution context
- asset readiness
- token metadata
- token audit and risk signals
- smart-money and market signals
- optional social distribution

### 2. Arbitrage Module = strategy layer

This is where high-value logic lives:

- opportunity detection
- context enrichment
- thresholding
- policy checks
- simulation
- decision routing
- summaries and reporting

### 3. OnchainOS backend = execution layer

The current working backend already provides:

- runtime orchestration
- simulation
- risk controls
- paper/live execution paths
- state tracking
- notification surfaces

### 4. Personal Butler = product layer

Personal Butler turns the whole thing into a product experience rather than a raw engine.

---

## The module workflow

The module should be understood through this flow:

```text
discover → enrich → validate → simulate → decide → execute → summarize
```

### Discover

Find a candidate opportunity.

### Enrich

Attach token, risk, balance, and signal context.

### Validate

Check spread quality, liquidity, quote freshness, and policy constraints.

### Simulate

Estimate post-cost and latency-adjusted viability.

### Decide

Choose whether to reject, monitor, paper-trade, propose execution, or execute.

### Execute

Run the approved action through the current backend.

### Summarize

Produce operator-ready and judge-friendly output.

## Why this is stronger than a plain skill catalog

A plain capability catalog can tell you:

- what a token is
- what a balance is
- what a signal says
- how to place a call

The Arbitrage Module does something more valuable:

- it combines multiple capabilities
- filters noise from signal
- checks safety and readiness
- simulates before action
- chooses the right operating mode
- explains its decision

That is the difference between:

- a toolset
- a strategy product

---

## Why this is stronger than a generic arbitrage bot

A generic arbitrage bot is usually judged on:

- speed
- venue access
- execution attempt

This module is designed to be judged on:

- decision quality
- explainability
- safety gating
- operator control
- ecosystem compatibility
- product readiness

That makes it a better flagship module for a demo, a hackathon, and a long-term platform story.

---

## Current implementation reality

This is not vapor.
The current repository already has real building blocks:

- a `dex-arbitrage` strategy plugin
- an engine loop
- simulation
- risk gating
- discovery sessions
- paper/live execution modes
- notification and reporting surfaces

The near-term work is not to invent everything from scratch.
It is to package the current capabilities into a clearer, ecosystem-aligned module.

---

## Ideal first demo takeaway

A strong demo should make the audience feel:

> this system does not just detect a spread — it turns ecosystem capabilities into a credible, simulation-backed arbitrage decision.

That is the right standard.

---

## What comes next

The near-term roadmap is:

1. stabilize the module contract
2. formalize reason codes and lifecycle states
3. map official skill inputs explicitly
4. add a thin compatibility / enrichment adapter layer
5. present one clean judge-facing paper-mode flow

This is a realistic path from current code to a stronger product story.

## One-sentence summary

**The Personal Butler Arbitrage Module is a Binance Skills-compatible, BNB ecosystem-native strategy layer that transforms market context, risk context, and execution infrastructure into explainable, simulation-backed arbitrage decisions.**
