# Arbitrage Skill Mapping

This document maps the Arbitrage Module to Binance official open skills and to the current internal implementation.

The purpose is to make one claim concrete:

> the Arbitrage Module is not a standalone black box; it is a strategy layer that can be built on top of Binance ecosystem skills while continuing to use the current execution backend underneath.

---

## 1. Mapping model

The mapping has three layers:

1. **official skill layer** — upstream ecosystem capabilities
2. **arbitrage module layer** — strategy, filtering, simulation, decisions
3. **backend layer** — current engine, state, and execution infrastructure

Think of it like this:

```text
Binance official skills → Arbitrage Module → execution backend → Product surfaces
```

---

## 2. Functional flow mapping

The arbitrage module flow is:

```text
discover → enrich → validate → simulate → decide → execute → summarize
```

The table below shows where capabilities should come from.

| Module stage | What happens | Binance official skill candidates | Current internal anchors |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| discover | detect raw opportunity candidates | `binance/spot`, `binance/alpha`, `binance-web3/crypto-market-rank`, `binance-web3/meme-rush`, `binance-web3/trading-signal` | discovery engine, `dex-arbitrage.ts` scan |
| enrich | attach token, market, and risk context | `binance-web3/query-token-info`, `binance-web3/query-token-audit`, `binance-web3/query-address-info`, `binance/assets` | metadata in opportunity, state store, enrichment adapter |
| validate | check thresholds and policy | `binance/assets`, `binance/spot`, optional audit / address signals | `dex-arbitrage.ts` evaluate, risk engine, cost model |
| simulate | estimate post-cost viability | upstream market context from `binance/spot` / `binance/alpha` | simulator, cost model |
| decide | produce paper / assisted-live / live decision | optional support from skill-derived context | evaluation + module adapter |
| execute | route approved plan into backend | `binance/spot`, `binance/alpha`, `binance/assets` as capability context; backend remains current execution path | execution client, engine |
| summarize | produce operator and judge outputs | `binance/square-post` for optional distribution | notifier, growth moments, share/report surfaces |

---

## 3. Capability groups

## Group A — required capability context

These are the minimum capabilities needed for a credible arbitrage flow.

| Need | Official skill candidates | Why required |
|------|---------------------------|--------------|
| market / price context | `binance/spot`, `binance/alpha` | determine whether a spread is real and actionable |
| account / asset readiness | `binance/assets` | confirm balances, asset availability, and operational readiness |
| execution context | `binance/spot`, `binance/alpha` | frame what an execution path could look like |

### Current status

- partially covered internally by current quotes, cost model, and backend integration
- official skill compatibility should first be expressed as mapping + adapter plan

---

## Group B — enrichment capability context

These capabilities increase confidence and presentation quality.

| Need | Official skill candidates | Why useful |
|------|---------------------------|-----------|
| token metadata | `binance-web3/query-token-info` | identify token, links, chain, metadata |
| token safety / audit | `binance-web3/query-token-audit` | reject obvious risk traps |
| address intelligence | `binance-web3/query-address-info` | inspect suspicious patterns or concentration if required |
| signal context | `binance-web3/trading-signal` | increase confidence or reduce false positives |
| market ranking / discovery | `binance-web3/crypto-market-rank`, `binance-web3/meme-rush` | widen candidate sourcing |

### Current status

- adapter pattern established for arbitrage flow integration
- primary use: enrichment adapters and compatibility layer

---

## Group C — optional distribution capability context

These capabilities matter after decision and execution.

| Need | Official skill candidates | Why useful |
|------|---------------------------|-----------|
| public reporting / social distribution | `binance/square-post` | share summarized opportunities, battle reports, or outcomes |

### Current status

- current system already has growth/report surfaces
- Binance Square posting can become an ecosystem-facing extension layer

## 5. Required vs optional for MVP

## Required for MVP compatibility story

These should be emphasized first:

1. `binance/spot`
2. `binance/assets`
3. `binance-web3/query-token-info`
4. `binance-web3/query-token-audit`

Why these four first:

- they cover discover / validate / safety / readiness / explanation
- they are enough to tell a credible compatibility story
- they match the arbitrage module’s judge-facing workflow well

## Strong optional enrichments for MVP+

1. `binance-web3/trading-signal`
2. `binance/alpha`
3. `binance/square-post`

## Later or scenario-driven enrichments

1. `binance-web3/query-address-info`
2. `binance-web3/crypto-market-rank`
3. `binance-web3/meme-rush`

---

---

## 7. Mapping to current code anchors

| Module need | Current code anchor | Gap |
|------------|---------------------|-----|
| raw opportunity scan | `src/skills/alphaos/plugins/dex-arbitrage.ts` | already present |
| structured evaluation | `dex-arbitrage.ts` evaluate | already present but needs normalized reason codes |
| planning | `dex-arbitrage.ts` plan | already present |
| simulation | `runtime/simulator.ts` | already present |
| cost breakdown | `runtime/cost-model.ts` | already present |
| execution handoff | `runtime/execution-client.ts` | already present |
| risk policy gates | `runtime/risk-engine.ts` | already present |
| discovery loop | `runtime/discovery/` | already present |
| official skill adapter layer | adapter pattern defined | extending |
| product-facing module output layer | schema defined | extending |
| public distribution via Square | design phase | planned |

---

## 8. Recommended first compatibility slice

If we want one realistic first slice, it should be:

### Inputs

- internal arbitrage candidate detection
- token metadata from `query-token-info`
- token safety from `query-token-audit`
- balance readiness from `assets`
- market context narrative from `spot`

### Output

- one structured candidate card
- one structured decision output
- one operator summary
- one judge-friendly explanation line

This is small enough to deliver but strong enough to demonstrate the architecture.

---

## 9. Recommended wording for external explanation

A short external explanation should sound like this:

> The Arbitrage Module builds on Binance ecosystem skills for market context, account readiness, token metadata, and token-risk enrichment, then combines those inputs with our own discovery, simulation, and execution backend to produce risk-aware arbitrage decisions.

That line is concise, truthful, and strong enough for demos and partner conversations.

---

## 10. One-sentence summary

**The Arbitrage Skill Mapping shows how official Binance skills should feed discovery, enrichment, validation, execution context, and reporting, while the current internal runtime continues to provide the strategy engine, simulation, risk controls, and execution backend.**
